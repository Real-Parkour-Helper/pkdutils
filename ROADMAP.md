# This is a approximate roadmap for the project

- [x] At least something
- [x] Simple working proxy to Hypixel for 1.8
- [x] Chattriggers-like functionality, i.e. determining which rooms were in the seed and sending them to the calc
- [x] Better scoreboard
- [x] Fix missing chunks (inside rooms and bridges only, missing finish room chunks not fixed yet)
- [ ] A Web GUI to display calc results and/or simple run analysis
- [ ] Newer versions support
- [ ] Some sort of tournament automation if that's possible
